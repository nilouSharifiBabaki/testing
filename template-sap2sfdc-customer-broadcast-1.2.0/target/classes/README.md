# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of customers from SAP to Salesforce.
Every time there is a new Customer (SFDC Account) or a change in an already existing one, SAP will send the IDoc with it to the running template which will update/create an account in the Salesforce target instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.

The integration is triggered by an SAP Endpoint that receives a SAP Customer as IDoc XML. This XML is passed to the batch process.
In the Batch Input stage the SAP Customer is transformed to a Salesforce Account and then upserted to Salesforce in the Batch Step using a Batch Commit.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies in oder to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, please continue reading.

You will find that there are three dependencies in the pom.xml file that begin with the following group id: 
	**com.sap.conn.jco** 
These dependencies are private for Mulesoft and will cause your application not to build from a Maven command line. You need to replace them with "provided" scope and copy the libraries into the build path.


## SAP Considerations <a name="sapconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding SAP, in order for this template to work.

### As source of data

SAP backend system is used as source of data. SAP Connector is used to send and receive the data from the SAP backend. 
The connector can either use RFC calls of BAPI functions and/or IDoc messages for data exchange and needs to be properly customized as per chapter: [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)

The Partner profile needs to have a customized type of logical system set as partner type. An outbound parameter of message type DEBMAS should be defined in the partner profile. A RFC destination created earlier should be defined as Receiver Port. Idoc Type base type should be set as DEBMAS01.

## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

###FAQ

 - Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one?

### As destination of data

This template makes use of the `External ID` field offered by Salesforce. Here is a short description on how SFDC define external ID's 

+ [What is an external ID?](http://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=faq_import_general_what_is_an_external.htm)

The templates uses the External ID in order to do xRef between the entities in both systems. The idea is, once an entity is created in SFDC it's decorated with an ID from the source system which will be used aftewards for the template to reference it.

You will need to create a new custom field in your **Account** entity in SFDC with the following name: 

+ `sap_external_id`

For instructions on how to create a custom field in SFDC please check this link:

### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)
+ Anypoint Studio Project from External Location
+ Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml
+ Mule ESB Configuration XML from External Location

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`

Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Mule Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:
### Application configuration
**SAP Connector configuration**

+ sap.jco.ashost=your.sap.address.com
+ sap.jco.user=SAP_USER
+ sap.jco.passwd=SAP_PASS
+ sap.jco.sysnr=14
+ sap.jco.client=800
+ sap.jco.lang=EN

**SAP Endpoint configuration**

+ sap.jco.connectioncount=2
+ sap.jco.gwhost=your.sap.addres.com
+ sap.jco.gwservice=sapgw14
+ sap.jco.idoc.programid=PROGRAM_ID

**SalesForce Connector configuration**

+ sfdc.username=bob.dylan@sfdc
+ sfdc.password=DylanPassword123
+ sfdc.securityToken=avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X
+ sfdc.url=https://test.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/32.0

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Customer Broadcast Template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X / 200**

Being X the number of Customers to be synchronized on each run.

The division by 200 is because, by default, Customers are gathered in groups
of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider
that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 1 api
calls to SFDC will be made (1).


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
A functional aspect of this Anypoint Template implemented in this XML is to create or update objects in the destination system for a represented use case. You can customize and extend the logic of this Anypoint Template in this XML to more specifically meet your needs.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is file is conformed by a Flow containing the endpoints for triggering the template and retrieving the objects that meet the defined criteria in the query. And then executing the batch job process with the query results.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Choice Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Choice+Exception+Strategy) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
